# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis is to identify a general guidance on the goal amount needed and time of year to hold a kickstarter campaign.  We are seeking to understand what an appropriate goal is and if there is such thing as asking for too much or too little.  We seek to understand the most optimal time of year to obtain these funds and if timing is a factor on when to hold a campaign.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The number of successful plays declines as the goal amount increases.  The line chart may show an increase around 30,000 but its important
to note that the total projects are significantly lower in these ranges.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I did not encounter any significant difficulties.  It took me a minute to remeber how to complete the COUNTIFS formula and I needed to reference the hint to spark my memory.  
One challenge I had was combating my prior experience and formating preferences with Excel to comply with the course expectations.


## Results

**- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
June yeilds a 49% chance of a successful theater event and May yeilds a 46%. It is not advisable to have a theater event from November through January 

**- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
The higher the goal for the campaign, the less likely you are to have success.

**- What are some limitations of this dataset?**
There are no indications or sub-outcomes that could assist in pointing to a reason or cancelation or failure.  In other words, if either of the aforementioned categories had a sub-category this could help us identify a cause for failure or cancelation.

**- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
We could look at the length of campaigns to attempt to understand what the appropriate length of a campaign should be.  
We could look at spotlight and staff pick to attempt to identify if there is any influence from these categories on the liklihood of success or failure of a particular kickstarter
